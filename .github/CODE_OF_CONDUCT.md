# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participating in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Since the project is in its early stages and does not have designated community leaders, the following enforcement guidelines will be adapted:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning for minor violations, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. **Temporary Ban**: For more serious violations, a temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

3. **Permanent Ban**: For severe violations, especially those involving harassment, aggression, or repeated offenses, a permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
